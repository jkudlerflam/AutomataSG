# AutomataSG
Python3 package for simulating and analyzing cellular automata on the Sierpinski Gasket.
This ipython notebook can be modified to simulate many different models but currently is compatible with:
Internal Diffusion Limited Aggregation (IDLA), Rotor-Router Aggregation (RRA), the Abelian Sandpile Model (ASM), Oil-Water Model, and Manna Model.
With a little bit of modification, it can be used for simulating cellular automata on other graphs. 
For those interested in the research that has relied on this package, see:
